📈 BTC & Forex (Gold/Silver) Price Prediction System
This repository contains the Complete Roadmap and Prediction System for high-volatility financial markets. By leveraging Machine Learning and technical analysis, this project provides a data-driven approach to forecasting price movements for Bitcoin (BTC), Major Forex pairs, Gold, and Silver.

🎯 Project Overview
Predicting financial markets is notoriously difficult due to "noise." This system acts as a complete roadmap, moving beyond simple price guessing to provide a structured analysis of market cycles. It is designed to assist traders in identifying high-probability zones using historical data and neural networks.

🚀 Key Features

Multi-Asset Support: Unified prediction models for Crypto (BTC), Forex (EUR/USD, GBP/USD), and Commodities (XAU/USD, XAG/USD).

Deep Learning Integration: Utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU networks to handle time-series financial data.

Technical Indicator Suite: Automated calculation of RSI, MACD, Moving Averages, and Bollinger Bands to feed the model.

Predictive Roadmap: A visual "Roadmap" UI that suggests potential entry/exit zones based on forecasted trends.

Real-time Data Fetching: Integration with financial APIs (like Binance, OANDA, or Yahoo Finance) for up-to-the-minute analysis.
